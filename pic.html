    goSTOPS Munnar is located in Anachal, merely 30 minutes away from the main town of Munnar, which stands at 6000 ft in the Idukki region of Kerala. Away from the crowds and yet, equipped with all amenities, the property stands amidst tropical plantations and close to all the main attractions: the Mattupetty dam, Pothamedu viewpoint, and the Top Station viewpoint - the highest point in Munnar. Learn about the diverse flora and fauna during your morning and evening walks, take a Shikara ride on Kundala Lake, and soak in views of the lush green foliage around you.
    
    How to get there: Fly to Cochin International Airport (110 km away by car) or Madurai International Airport (140 km away by car). Alternatively, you can take a train to Ernakulam or Madurai; Aluva is the nearest stop to Munnar (110km away). Munnar is also well-connected by bus from several locations in Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
    
    Cost: Dorms starting at Rs 399 per night and private rooms starting at Rs 1,299 per night.</p>
    <h1>GOA</h1>

    <p>A true Goa-lover knows that monsoons are a world-apart in the coastal state. Empty, drenched beaches, pristine greens, swelling waterfalls, and off-season pricing – what’s not to love?

        Explore Goa's art and culture scene, the heritage buildings in the South, or go find your own private plunge pool. There’s more to Goa than its beaches and this is best explored in the rainy season! Fort Aguada, Dudhsagar Falls, and Chapora Fort are just some of the many options.
        
        The best part? goSTOPS has not one but TWO properties here to choose from in North Goa — one at Baga and the other at Calangute.</p>

<p>Say goodbye to the hustle-bustle of city life and enter the world of mountains, meadows, and tea plantations in Ooty. An abode of the clouds in the monsoons and located at an elevation of 2,200 ft, this charming hill station feels like it's straight out of a storybook. Aptly called ‘the Queen of the Hills’, nestled in the blue Nilgiri mountains, the colonial past of the place mixed with its heritage buildings and its enthralling natural landscape, makes it one of South India’s most popular tourist destinations. You can visit Dolphin’s Nose Viewpoint, the Botanical Gardens, and take a ride on the famous Nilgiri toy train from Mettupalayam to Ooty!</p>

It is close to the Gymkhana Golf Club and has two blocks - the heritage block which is a 100-year-old colonial bungalow with high roofs, wooden flooring, four poster beds, and vintage furniture - and the new block, with ample outdoor seating and modern amenities.

    How to get there: Coimbatore Airport is the nearest airport and is about 88 km away. The nearest train station is Mettupalayam which is well-connected to all major cities in the South. There are also several luxury buses that can take you directly to Ooty from Bangalore, Mysore, and Chennai.</p>

<p>Imagine exploring the Venice of the East on a houseboat! Alleppey - the hub of Kerala’s backwaters laced with coconut trees - is one of the most picturesque destinations in India and comes to life in the monsoons. With countless canals, delicious seafood, and the lush Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary on the banks of Vembanad lake, a laid-back yet fun-filled trip is guaranteed!</p>

<p>Further, goSTOPS Alleppey is just 400 m from the beach, making it the perfect location to enjoy the sea, backwaters, as well as the tourist spots in the city. Don’t forget to check out the Alleppey Lighthouse and Vijaya Park, although the goSTOPS property in itself is perfect for a staycation! It is peaceful and quaint with well-equipped common rooms where you can engage in some fun like board games and foosball, not to mention the chiku trees in the courtyard that make for a beautiful photo backdrop!
